 - Reading both odt and rtf files
 - Saving to PDF files

 - Current file indicator as well as it saved status denoted by * for unsaved
 - Syntax highlighting, code folding, auto indentation and 

The repositry also has CI setup to run the unit tests.

A clone of this repo and building it should let it run smoothly. The only external file it needs is the config.txt file however this is by default in the rerpo.
